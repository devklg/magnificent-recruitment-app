# MAGNIFICENT RECRUITMENT APP - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
## üöÄ EVERYTHING - COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM DESIGN

---

## 1. RULE FILES FOR BMAD V4 AGENTS

### üéØ ALEXA (Frontend Lead) - Enhanced Rules
```markdown
# ALEXA SHADCN-UI MCP RULES v2.0

## CORE BEHAVIOR
- ALWAYS use shadcn-ui MCP server for ALL UI components
- NEVER manually implement components - use MCP demo patterns
- Prioritize BLOCKS over individual components
- Systematic planning BEFORE any code implementation

## WORKFLOW SEQUENCE
1. Query available components using list_components
2. Query available blocks using list_blocks  
3. Get component demos for proper usage patterns
4. Plan complete UI structure with component mapping
5. Implement using exact demo patterns

## RECRUITMENT APP PRIORITIES
- Landing Page: Use marketing blocks + hero components
- Authentication: Login/signup blocks with form components
- Dashboards: Dashboard blocks + data display components
- Mobile: Responsive components with touch interactions
- Marketing: Card components + animation elements

## QUALITY STANDARDS
- Enterprise-grade appearance mandatory
- Accessibility compliance built-in
- Scarlet theme customization required
- Performance optimization standard
```

### üîß MARCUS/JAMES (Backend) - Enhanced Rules
```markdown
# MARCUS/JAMES BACKEND INTEGRATION RULES v2.0

## SHADCN COORDINATION
- Design APIs to match shadcn component data requirements
- Ensure WebSocket integration supports real-time components
- Create data structures optimized for shadcn table/chart components
- Build authentication flows compatible with shadcn form patterns

## RECRUITMENT API DESIGN
- Prospect management APIs for DataTable components
- Real-time position updates for Badge/Card components
- Commission data APIs for Chart/Analytics components
- User management APIs for Admin Dashboard blocks

## INTEGRATION STANDARDS
- RESTful APIs with shadcn-friendly JSON structure
- WebSocket events for live component updates
- File upload APIs for video/image components
- Authentication middleware for protected components
```

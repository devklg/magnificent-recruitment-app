# Workflow Test File

Generated: $(date)
Agent: $TEST_AGENT
Test Purpose: Validate agent workflow system

## Features Tested
- [x] Feature branch creation
- [x] Automated commits
- [x] PR generation
- [x] Workflow validation

## Workflow Steps
1. Create feature branch from agent branch
2. Commit changes to feature branch
3. Push feature branch to origin
4. Create Pull Request automatically
5. Ready for review and merge

**Status: Testing Complete ✅**
